# Semantic Versioning for the Shell

We provide [SemVer][] 2.0.0 compliant tools that help to work with Semantic
Versionin in the shell.

## Run the Tests

The test script can be run with [roundup][]. On OS X, install it with
`brew install roundup`. Heads up: the [debian package][roundup-debian] is
something different. This is the case for [other Linux distributions]
[roundup-fedora] as well.
